# Introduction

In this workshop, we are going to learn how to go through the process of doing *machine learning* on a set of data.   To do so, we will download a *corpus* of text data to work with, extract *features* from this data, and do *supervised* machine learning to our data, using a mathmatical algorithm to train a *classifier* which will then classify previously unseen data into a set of predefined categories.



> "Machine learning is a research field that sits at the intersection of statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer science. It is also known as *predictive analytics* or *statistical learning*."

## Key terms
- *machine learning*: an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed

- *corpus*: a large collection of data.  In our case, this will be text data (although a corpus can contain any type of data)

- *dataset*: a collection of related information (such as a corpus)

    - *variable*: an attribute of the dataset (such as the type of text being analyzed)

    - *observation*: an entry in the dataset (a single text)

    - *measurement*: a single data point (eg: one text's type)

- *features*: properties that describe data attributes for machine learning—often the variables

- *feature representation, feature vector*: a set of features


- *supervised machine learning*:  a machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs

- *unsupervised machine learning*: a machine learning task used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labelled responses (lacks input-output pairs; only has input data)


- *algorithm*: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations (or other problem-solving operations), particularly by a computer


- *classification*: a machine learning task used to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined list of possibilities
