    "Welcome!  In this workshop, we are going to learn how to go through the process of doing *machine learning* on a set of data.   To do so, we will download a *corpus* of text data to work with, extract *features* from this data, and do *supervised* machine learning to our data, using a mathmatical algorithm to train a*classifier* which will then classify previously unseen data into a set of predefined categories.\n",

    "In this workshop, you will learn the following skills:\n",
    "- How to use skills from the NLTK workshop to build features for a classification task\n",
    "- How to build a text classification system that can predict whether sentences belong to one category (\"news\") or another (\"romance\")\n",
    "- How to prepare data for machine learning using *pandas*, a package for Python that helps to organize your data\n",
    "    - Looks similar to an Excel spreadsheet\n",
    "- How to use the scikit-learn package for Python to perform machine learning on the data\n",
    "- How to evaluate the results of the classifier, helping to decide whether the classifier is effective\n",
    "- How to adjust paramaters of a classifier to improve accuracy\n",

    "# How does supervised machine learning work?\n",
    "Supervised machine learning takes places in two steps - the *training* phase, and the *testing* phase.  In the training phase, you use a portion of your data to *train* your algorithm (which, in our case, is a classification algorithm).  You provide both your feature vector and your labels to the algorithm, and the algorithm searches for patterns in your data that can help associate it with a particular label.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the testing phase, we use the classifier we trained in the previous step, and give it previously unseen feature vectors representing unseen data to the algorithm, and have the algorithm predict the label.  We can then compare the \"true\" label to the predicted label, and see if our classifier provides us with a good and generlizable way of accomplishing the task (in our case, the task of automatically distinguishing news sentences from romance sentences).\n",
